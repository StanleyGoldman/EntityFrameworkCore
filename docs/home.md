# Welcome to the Entity Framework Core Project Wiki

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

## Design notes archive

[Design meeting notes](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aarea-design-notes) are archived as issues in our issue tracker.

In addition, we have a few old design documents here. Note that some of the documents may still refer to EF Core as "EF 7", a name we used before release.
